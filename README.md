# Habitor

Habitor is a habit tracking web application built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com/), and [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/), all using TypeScript. I use [Kinde](https://kinde.com) for authentication.

## Features

- **Habit Types** You can select a simple checkbox(yes/no) habit, or one that takes text or number inputs
- **Time-based Habits** Habits are categorized into different times of the day - Morning, Mid-Day, and Evening.
- **Specific Days** Pick which days of the week you want the habit on
- **Streak Tracking** Keep track of your current streak, even if the habit isn't scheduled every day

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed at [https://habit0r.vercel.app](https://habit0r.vercel.app).
